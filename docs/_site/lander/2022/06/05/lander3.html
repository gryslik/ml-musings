    <p>In part two of the lunar lander series, we showcased the basics of how our AI agent trains and creates models
for flying the lander successfully, however, lots of questions were left unanswered about our design choices. This
third and final post will answer the why behind our hyper parameter and architecture choices.</p>

<h3>Background knowledge</h3>
<h4>Neural net</h4>
<p>In post 2, we showcased the neural net structure and left it at that. Now let’s dive into how a neural net works.
The below image gives a visual representation of what you already know.</p>

<p><img src="/images/neuralnetsimple.png" alt="Neural net Simple" /></p>

<p>Data that gets passed into an input layer,
some hidden layers transform the input, and we get an output through the output layer. 
But how does the data get passed through each node? The diagram below illustrates that process for each node.</p>

<p><img src="/images/neuralnet1node.png" alt="Neural net detailed" /></p>

<p>Each layer of the net is connected to the previous layer, and each node-to-node connection has a certain <em>weight</em>.
For each node, the previous nodes connecting to it are the <em>inputs</em>. Every input gets multiplied by a weight and has a <em>bias</em>
added to it, and then they all get summed up. This is the <em>weighted sum</em>.
The weighted sum is passed into an <em>activation function</em> which returns an output. This output is the value 
of a single node in the next layer.</p>

<p>There are a couple types of activation functions, some of the most common being linear, relu, and sigmoid. All they
do is given a value x, pass it into a function that returns a new value. For example f(x) = k * x is a linear 
activation function that returns x multiplied by some constant k. Relu and sigmoid are just more complex, nonlinear functions.</p>

<p>So essentially:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Input layer values are set by the data (observations)</li>
  <li>Each node in the next layer calculates its value by getting the weighted sum of all the nodes in the previous layer
and passing the weighted sum through an activation function</li>
  <li>Repeat step 2 until we’re out of the neural net</li>
</ol>

<p>This happens every single frame of lunar lander. An observation about the environment gets passed in, and the neural net
spits out an action through the above process. But how does the agent optimize the neural net?</p>

<h4>Action -&gt; Response -&gt; Reward</h4>
<p>In reinforcement learning, this is the basic learning cycle. As displayed below, an agent takes an action and
predicts the reward of this action.
The action produces a response from the environment, with both a new state and actual reward. The agent compares its predicted reward 
to the actual reward. The agent optimizes itself based on the deviation, and takes a new action. This is done by changing
the weights and biases within its neural net through a process called backpropagation. <em>The structure of the neural net never
changes, only the weights and biases change.</em>
This pattern continues until the agent is able to accurately predict the rewards of actions, and then the agent knows
what actions to take.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rlcycle.png" alt="Reinforcement Learning Cycle" /></p>

<p>You may remember a hyper parameter we defined in the last post, epsilon, alongside minimum epsilon and epsilon decay.
Epsilon ranges from 0-1 and is the probability that we choose a random action over what we think will be best. When we
start the agent, it has a high epsilon and thus chooses mostly random values, but tries to predict the reward each time.
As it makes predictions and sees the results, it fine tunes its ability to make predictions. This is done by changing 
the weights within the neural net. Eventually, it starts choosing what it believes to be the optimum action instead of
a random one, how fast this happens depends on our initial epsilon and epsilon decay.</p>

<p>This can be seen in the below act function, which is responsible for performing and returning an action</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An agent predicts the best action using something called the Bellman Equation</p>

<h4>Bellman Equation</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-equation/">Bellman’s Equation</a>
, as said in the linked article, states that the long-term reward of an action is equal to the reward of
the action itself plus the expected reward from the following actions.</p>

<p>To understand this better, let’s use a concrete example from the Lunar Lander scenario. When the lander touches a leg
to the ground, it earns a certain number of points, but when the lander crashes it loses significantly more points.
If the lander tries to land too fast, it will first gain points for touching the ground, and then lose all those points
and many more for crashing. The Bellman’s equation will produce a low reward for attempting to land when
moving too fast because the future reward is highly negative.</p>

<p>The learning agent uses the Bellman Equation to predict the value of the current state.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bellman.png" alt="Bellman Equation" /></p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>V(s) is the value of state s</li>
  <li>max a denotes the optimal action in the current state</li>
  <li>R(s, a) is the reward for action a in state s</li>
  <li>γ is gamma a.k.a the discount factor (one of our hyper parameters) and ranges from 0-1</li>
  <li>s’ is the next state resulting from taking action a in state s</li>
  <li>V(s’) is the value of the next state</li>
</ul>

<p>To summarize, the value of our current state is equal to the reward of taking the optimal action in the current state
plus the discount factor times the value of the resulting state.</p>

<h3>Understanding optimality of our hyper parameters</h3>
<p>With the background knowledge, we can now infer why our chosen parameters are optimal</p>

<h4>Discount factor</h4>
<p>Discount factor, or gamma, was used in the Bellman Equation to give a weight to the value of future predicted rewards.
This essentially controls how far into the future we look, with a larger discount factor giving us farther vision into the future.
We’ve set our gamma very high, at 0.99. Why? Think about how many frames are in a single game of lunar lander. <em>A lot</em>.
If we only take a couple frames into account when making predictions, there’s no way we’ll build an accurate model. Not a
lot changes in between frames, so maximizing the discount factor ensures we look far enough into the future to make accurate
predictions.</p>

<p>Gamma was initially guessed at 0.9, which produced bad results, however 0.99 worked just fine</p>

<h4>Epsilon</h4>
<p>Just like gamma needed to be set very high because of the number of frames per game, so does epsilon need to be set high
and epsilon decay needs to be slow. Each individual frame has little impact on the outcome. If epsilon
decay happens quickly, the model will start taking “optimal actions” far before it knows what “optimal” is. This may
cause the agent to get stuck in what’s called a local minima. Essentially, the agent will continue to take similar actions
again and again because it thinks other actions are sub-optimal, even if its current behavior is bad. An example of this
would be cutting the engine completely and letting the lander crash because of the reward from touching the legs.</p>

<p>We prevent this with a high epsilon and slow decay, causing the model to train on lots of random actions before picking
optimal actions.</p>

<p>Epsilon decay was guessed at around 0.9, but this wasn’t high enough initially and produced very bad results.
Then 0.99 was attempted, followed by 0.999. This was then decremented to 0.998, 0.997, etc and 0.996 was found to be
the optimal value</p>

<h4>Learning rate</h4>
<p>Learning rate needs to be <em>sloooooow</em>, also because of the minimum impact of each frame. We want our agent to slowly adjust
it’s behavior from each frame for this reason. We have many, many frames, each very similar to the last. By setting
a slow learning rate, we prevent the agent from over-adjusting from each action.</p>

<p>“Oh, firing the engine in this frame was better than not firing the engine? Okay, let me fire the main engine for 
EVERY SINGLE FRAME FROM NOW ON”</p>

<p>Bad idea.</p>

<p>Currently, the learning rate is set to 0.01, this was found by setting it to a low value of 0.1 and dividing by 10 
until a workable figure was found. Increasing the learning rate to 0.01, for example, results in complete failure and the
agent unable to succeed even by episode 500.</p>

<h3>Optimality of neural net design</h3>

<p>With our neural net, 2 things were predetermined based on the environment, that being input and output dimension.
The hidden layers, activation functions, and loss function were things we had to choose.</p>

<p>To review, we have two hidden layers, the first one having 150 and the second one having 120 nodes. Both use
the relu activation function. The output layer uses a linear activation function. The loss function we are using is
means squared error (mse).</p>

<h4>Node and layer counts</h4>
<p>Quite frankly, it is very difficult to say for sure that a particular node/layer count is optimal. It’s very much
an experimental process until the best one is discovered. Having too many layers can create a model that’s overfitted
to the training (meaning it won’t generalize well to environments different than the ones it trained on),
and too few causes the model to be too simple and fail to properly train for any environment.
Two hidden layers worked well, so we stuck with that.</p>

<p>For node count, a commonly used strategy is to gradually decrease the node count in the hidden layers. This is why
we went from 150 to 120. Once again, there are no clear “rules” here. It’s best to experiment and find what works best</p>

<h4>Activation functions</h4>
<p>We used relu as the activation function for the hidden layers, and linear for the output.</p>

<p><em>A relu activation function is the same as linear, except that the minimum output of relu is always 0</em>.</p>

<p>It is one of the most commonly used activation functions and often the default, so we felt no need to deviate.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Hopefully, this example has given you an idea of the basics of reinforcement learning, the different components
involved in the process and how it can be fine tuned for better results. In our next series, we will be doing
reinforcement learning on a more complicated environment, Mario. Stay tuned!</p>
